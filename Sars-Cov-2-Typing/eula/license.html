<b>SARS-CoV-2 Plugin</b><br>


<p>This plugin contains some algorithms to extend the CLC Genomics Workbench to support SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Projects</p>

These tools are taken from an Influenza Typing Plugin I coded some time ago. 
This Influenza Typing plugin is in active use by the Dutch Reference Lab for Avian Influenza in the Netherlands. 
Influenza typing is far more complex than typing SARS-CoV-2. Influenza has a fragmented genome and the similarity between subspecies is about 85%. 

For the Of SARS-CoV-2 plugin, I removed the fragmented genome support and some tools that are specific for Influenza (like the cleavage site analysis)

If you are interested in the Influenza Plugin you can reach out to me at dekker_p@yahoo.com
